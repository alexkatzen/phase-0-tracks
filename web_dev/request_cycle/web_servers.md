### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A virtual private server is a virtual server machine created in memory and typically sold by internet hosting services to customers to host their websites. A VPS behaves as if it is its own physical machine with its own installation of an operating system, but without the actual access to any physical components.

  * Highly configurable - complete access to the installation of the operating system, ability to operate as the root user.
  * Host unlimited number of websites and other services e.g. mail server, FTP server.
  * Stability - only your content is hosted on your _private_ server (not shared with others).
  * Easily scalable.
  * More affordable.
