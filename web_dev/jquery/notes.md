### JQuery fire drill

Resources to check out/find:
  * Official documentation
  * Books I already own (JavaScript & JQuery - Duckett)
  * Find 2-3 on-line tutorials for beginners
  * Cheat Sheets

Learn the thing:
  * 10-15m finding tutorials
  * Take one beginner tutorial ~1hr
      - This was definitely the most effective way of getting the very basics.
  * Spend ~30/45m browsing the book.
      - This was not so helpful in the short amount of time/without a clear goal of what specifically I was looking for.
  * Spend rest of time learning how to reference docs/cheat sheets
      - This was good to look at, but would probably be more helpful when actually trying to make something.
