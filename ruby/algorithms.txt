Elevator Algorithm:

- Take in two parameters: (up-or-down, desired_floor)
    - If the elevator door is open:
        - Enter the elevator.
    - If the elevator door is closed:
        - Look at elevator call buttons adjacent to the elevator door:
            - If up-or-down is up:
                - Press the up arrow.
            - If up-or-down is down:
                - Press the down arrow.
        - If elevator doors open:
            - Enter the elevator.
    - Once inside the elevator, find the elevator control panel adjacent to the door on the inside of the elevator:
        - For each button:
            - If Button Number contains star character, Button Number = (Button Number - star character).
            - Floor Number = Button Number
        - For each button:
            - If Floor Number == desired_floor
                - Press the button.
            - Otherwise:
                - Say "Sorry, that floor doesn't exist!".
    - When elevator doors open, exit the elevator.
