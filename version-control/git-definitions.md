# Git Definitions

Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  * Version control is a system for managing the entire history of revisions to one or more files, by one or many contributors. It is useful because it allows for many people to work concurrently on the same project in a streamlined and safe way, and provides a record of the files as they change over time that can be accessed in order to track down specific changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  * A branch is a copy of the files in a git repository as they exist either on a master branch, or another branch at a specific point in time. You create a new branch when you want to make changes to the master or another specified branch that you will then merge back in when you are finished.
  
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  * A commit represents a specific change to a file or group of files that you can access later as "save points" in the file's git history. A good commit message is succinct and describes precisely what change is.

* What is a merge conflict?
  * A merge conflict usually occurs when changes to the exact same line are made in two seperate branches that are being merged, or a file is deleted that the another person is trying to edit.
